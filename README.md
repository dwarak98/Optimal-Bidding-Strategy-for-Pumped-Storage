# Optimal-Bidding-Strategy-for-Pumped-Storage

An algorithm for maximizing pumped storage profits considering reserve bids is presented. Profit maximization is based on generating power at higher prices (MCP) and pumping energy at lower prices. The algorithm developed optimizes the units based on a weekly basis with hourly prices This algorithm is tested with Jan 2019 day-ahead price data of Long island NYISO. 
Multistage looping optimization is developed to schedule a pumped storage unit.
The capacity and operational constraints are also accounted for using the looping method.
